\title{Easy Regression Uplift Modeling (Two-Model / Indirect Approach)}
\usage{
easy_uplift(
  model,
  treatment,
  newdata = NULL,
  bins = 10,
  aspect_ratio = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted regression model of class \code{glm} (binary logit) or
\code{lm}.}

\item{treatment}{Character string giving the name of the treatment variable.
The variable must have exactly two levels and be coded as (0/1), logical,
or (\code{"Yes"}, \code{"No"}).}

\item{newdata}{Optional data frame on which to compute uplift (e.g., holdout
or test data). If \code{NULL}, uplift is computed on the model data.}

\item{bins}{Integer; number of groups used for the uplift tables and plots.
Must be between 5 and 20. Default is 10.}

\item{aspect_ratio}{Optional numeric aspect ratio applied to all plots.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{Backward-compatible alias support. If \code{ar} is supplied, it is
treated as \code{aspect_ratio}.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"easy_uplift"} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{$group} Uplift results by ordered group (based on \code{bins})
\item \code{$all} Observation-level data with predicted lift appended
\item \code{$plots} A list of ggplot objects: Qini (\code{$qini}),
mean uplift by group (\code{$uplift}), and cumulative gain
(\code{$c.gain})
\item \code{$models} Fitted subgroup models: \code{$control} and \code{$treat}
\item \code{$covariates} Character vector of covariates used in the subgroup models
\item \code{$treatment_var} Treatment variable name
\item \code{$outcome_var} Outcome variable name
\item \code{$spec} Metadata describing the uplift specification
}
}
\description{
Perform uplift modeling using the two-model (indirect) approach based on a
fitted regression model. Supported model types include binary logistic
regression estimated via \code{glm(..., family = binomial(link = "logit"))}
and linear regression estimated via \code{lm()}.
}
\details{
The user supplies a fitted regression model that includes a binary treatment
variable with exactly two levels. The function fits two separate subgroup
models—one for the control group and one for the treated group—using the
predictors from the original model, excluding:
\itemize{
\item the treatment main effect, and
\item any interaction terms involving the treatment variable.
}

Predicted uplift (incremental effect) is computed as:
\deqn{lift = \hat{y}_{treat} - \hat{y}_{control}}

Predictions are generated on the original model data by default, or on
\code{newdata} if supplied.

This function replaces the deprecated \code{reguplift()} function and is the
recommended interface going forward.

# Binary outcome (logistic regression)
m <- glm(y ~ age + income + promotion,
         data = df,
         family = binomial(link = "logit"))
res <- easy_uplift(m, treatment = "promotion", bins = 10)

# Continuous outcome (linear regression)
m2 <- lm(y ~ age + income + promotion, data = df)
res2 <- easy_uplift(m2, treatment = "promotion", bins = 10)

# Holdout uplift
res_holdout <- easy_uplift(m, treatment = "promotion",
                           newdata = test, bins = 10)
