\title{Cutoff Diagnostics for Binary Logistic Regression}
\usage{
cutoff_logistic(
  MOD,
  DATA,
  POSITIVE,
  LABEL1 = "Sample 1",
  DATA2 = NULL,
  LABEL2 = "Sample 2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MOD}{Fitted binary logistic regression model (\code{glm} with
\code{family = "binomial"}).}

\item{DATA}{Data frame for which cutoff diagnostics are computed
(e.g., training data).}

\item{POSITIVE}{Factor level representing the positive / "success" class.}

\item{LABEL1}{Character label for \code{DATA} used in the plot title.
Defaults to \code{"Sample 1"}.}

\item{DATA2}{Optional second data frame (e.g., test/holdout data) for
which a second cutoff diagnostics plot is produced. Defaults to
\code{NULL} (no second data set).}

\item{LABEL2}{Character label for \code{DATA2} used in the second plot
title. Defaults to \code{"Sample 2"}.}
}
\value{
If only \code{DATA} is provided, returns a single \code{ggplot} object
(and prints it).

If both \code{DATA} and \code{DATA2} are provided, returns a list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{$sample1}: ggplot for \code{DATA} (label \code{LABEL1})
\item \code{$sample2}: ggplot for \code{DATA2} (label \code{LABEL2})
}
and prints both plots.
}
\description{
Plot sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy across classification cutoffs
for a fitted binary logistic regression model. Can be used for a single
data set (e.g., training) or for two data sets (e.g., training and test)
using the same fitted model.
}
\details{
The outcome variable MUST be a factor with exactly two levels, and
\code{POSITIVE} must match one of those levels.

For each cutoff from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01, the function computes:
\itemize{
\item Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)
\item Specificity (True Negative Rate)
\item Accuracy
}
and produces a ggplot line chart with a consistent visual style
(theme_bw, legend at bottom) to help choose a reasonable cutoff.
