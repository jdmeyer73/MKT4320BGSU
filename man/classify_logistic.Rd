\title{Classification Matrix for Binary Logistic Regression}
\usage{
classify_logistic(
  MOD,
  DATA,
  POSITIVE,
  CUTOFF = 0.5,
  DATA2 = NULL,
  LABEL1 = "Sample 1",
  LABEL2 = "Sample 2",
  digits = 3,
  ft = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MOD}{A fitted binary logistic regression \code{glm} object
(i.e., \code{family = "binomial"}).}

\item{DATA}{A data frame for which the classification matrix should be produced.}

\item{POSITIVE}{The level representing the positive outcome.}

\item{CUTOFF}{Probability cutoff for classification (default = 0.5).}

\item{DATA2}{Optional second data frame (e.g., test/holdout sample).}

\item{LABEL1}{Label for the first data set.}

\item{LABEL2}{Label for the second data set (if provided).}

\item{digits}{Number of decimal places (default = 3).}

\item{ft}{Logical; if TRUE, return a combined flextable (default = FALSE).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with \code{sample1} and (optionally) \code{sample2}.
}
\description{
Create a classification matrix and selected statistics for a fitted
binary logistic regression model. Optionally, produce results for a
second data set (e.g., test/holdout sample) using the same model and
cutoff.
}
\details{
Predictions are based on a specified cutoff. When \code{ft = FALSE},
the function prints a full console report including accuracy, PCC,
the classification matrix (with totals), and selected statistics for
the positive class. When \code{ft = TRUE}, a single combined flextable
is returned with identical content and layout.
