\title{Check Train/Test Split}
\usage{
check_split(train, test, outcome)
}
\arguments{
\item{train}{A data frame containing the training data.}

\item{test}{A data frame containing the testing data.}

\item{outcome}{Name of the factor outcome variable (unquoted or quoted).}
}
\value{
An invisible list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{n_summary}: Data frame of row counts and proportions for train/test.
\item \code{outcome_summary}: List of class counts and proportions for each split.
}

The function prints a concise summary to the console.
}
\description{
Diagnostic summary for a train/test split created by
\code{\link{splitsample}}.
}
\details{
This function summarizes sample sizes and the distribution of the outcome
variable across the training and testing datasets.

The outcome variable \strong{must be a factor} in both datasets. If the
outcome is numeric or character, the function stops with a clear error
explaining how to convert it.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Correct usage
directmktg$buy <- factor(directmktg$buy, levels = c("no", "yes"))
check_split(train, test, buy)

# Incorrect: numeric outcome triggers an error
# check_split(train, test, buy_numeric)
}
