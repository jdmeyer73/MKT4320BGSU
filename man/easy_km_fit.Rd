\usage{
easy_km_fit(
  data,
  vars,
  k_range = 1:10,
  standardize = TRUE,
  nstart = 25,
  iter.max = 100,
  B = 20,
  seed = 4320
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the full dataset.}

\item{vars}{Character vector of variable names used for clustering. All
variables must be numeric.}

\item{k_range}{Integer vector of cluster counts to evaluate (e.g.,
\code{1:10}).}

\item{standardize}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, clustering variables are
standardized before fitting k-means (default = \code{TRUE}).}

\item{nstart}{Integer; number of random starts for k-means (default = 25).}

\item{iter.max}{Integer; maximum number of iterations allowed for each
k-means run (passed to \code{stats::kmeans()}, default = 100).}

\item{B}{Integer; number of Monte Carlo bootstrap samples for the Gap
statistic (passed to \code{cluster::clusGap()}, default = 20).}

\item{seed}{Integer; random seed for reproducible results (default = 4320).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{scree}{Data frame of WSS values by number of clusters.}
\item{scree_plot}{A ggplot elbow (WSS) plot.}
\item{silhouette}{Data frame of average silhouette widths by cluster count.}
\item{gap}{Gap statistic results (including the 1-SE rule).}
\item{km_all}{Named list of fitted \code{kmeans} objects, indexed by the
number of clusters.}
\item{row_index}{Row indices of \code{data} used for clustering.}
}
}
\description{
Fit k-means clustering solutions across a range of cluster counts and compute
common diagnostics including within-cluster sum of squares (WSS), average
silhouette width, and the Gap statistic.
}
\details{
This function is designed for teaching and exploratory segmentation analysis.
It consolidates functionality previously provided by \code{wssplot()} and
\code{ksize()} into a single, reproducible workflow.

Rows with missing values in the clustering variables are removed prior to
fitting. The row indices used for clustering are stored internally so cluster
assignments can be reattached to the original data if needed.
