\title{Gain and Lift Tables and Charts for Binary Logistic Regression}
\usage{
gainlift_logistic(MOD, TRAIN, TEST, POSITIVE)
}
\arguments{
\item{MOD}{Fitted binary logistic regression model (\code{glm} with
\code{family = "binomial"}).}

\item{TRAIN}{Training data used to estimate the model.}

\item{TEST}{Test or holdout data used for out-of-sample evaluation.}

\item{POSITIVE}{Factor level representing the positive / "success" class.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{gaintable}: Data frame of cumulative gain by group.
\item \code{lifttable}: Data frame of cumulative lift by group.
\item \code{gainplot}: \code{ggplot} object showing the cumulative gain curve.
\item \code{liftplot}: \code{ggplot} object showing the cumulative lift curve.
}
}
\description{
Compute cumulative gain and lift tables and corresponding plots for a fitted
binary logistic regression model, evaluated on training and test/holdout data.
}
\details{
The outcome variable in both \code{TRAIN} and \code{TEST} must be a factor with
exactly two levels, and \code{POSITIVE} must match one of those levels.

Observations are ranked by predicted probability of the positive class and
grouped into 20 equal-sized bins (i.e., demi-deciles). Cumulative gain and lift
are computed relative to a random model baseline.
