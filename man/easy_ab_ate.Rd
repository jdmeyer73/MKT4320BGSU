\title{Easy Average Treatment Effect for A/B Testing (Regression-Based)}
\usage{
easy_ab_ate(model, treatment, ft = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted linear regression model of class \code{lm}. This model
should include the treatment variable and (optionally) covariates.}

\item{treatment}{Character string. Name of the treatment variable (in quotes).}

\item{ft}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default) return a \code{flextable}. If
\code{FALSE}, print full regression results to the console and return an
invisible list with model objects and coefficient tables.}
}
\value{
If \code{ft = TRUE}, returns a \code{flextable}. If \code{ft = FALSE}, returns
an invisible list:
\code{list(model_simple, model_full, coef_simple, coef_full)}.
}
\description{
Compute the average treatment effect (ATE) for an A/B test using linear
regression. Results are shown for (1) a simple model with only the treatment
indicator and (2) an adjusted model that includes covariates (i.e., regression
adjustment).
}
\details{
This function requires an existing \code{lm} object that includes the
treatment variable and (optionally) any covariates. The "without covariates"
model is re-fit internally using the same outcome and data.

If the outcome is binary (0/1), the linear model is a linear probability
model (LPM). The estimated treatment coefficient is interpreted as an average
difference in probability (in percentage points when multiplied by 100).

When \code{ft = TRUE}, results are returned as a formatted \code{flextable}
comparing models with and without covariates.

\examples{
# m <- lm(y ~ promotion + age + income, data = df)
# easy_ab_ate(m, treatment = "promotion")
# easy_ab_ate(m, treatment = "promotion", ft = FALSE)
