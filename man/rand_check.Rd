\title{Randomization (Balance) Check for Experimental Designs}
\usage{
rand_check(data, treatment, covariates, ft = TRUE, digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the treatment indicator and covariates.}

\item{treatment}{Character string giving the name of the treatment variable.
Must identify two or more groups.}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariate names to include in the
randomization check.}

\item{ft}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), return results as a
\code{flextable}. If \code{FALSE}, return a data frame.}

\item{digits}{Integer; number of decimal places to display in the output
(default = 3).}
}
\value{
If \code{ft = TRUE}, a \code{flextable} summarizing balance tests by covariate.
Otherwise, a data frame with test statistics and p-values.
}
\description{
Perform a randomization (balance) check comparing covariate distributions
across treatment groups. The function automatically selects appropriate
statistical tests based on variable type and returns a concise summary
suitable for teaching, reporting, or diagnostics.
}
\details{
Continuous covariates are compared across treatment groups using
one-way ANOVA. Categorical covariates are evaluated using chi-squared
tests (or Fisher's exact test when expected cell counts are small).

By default, results are returned as a formatted \code{flextable}.
A plain data frame can be returned by setting \code{ft = FALSE}.

This function is intended to replace the deprecated \code{rcheck()}
function and should be used as the single source of truth going forward.
